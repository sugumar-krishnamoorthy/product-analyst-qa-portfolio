# About Me

**Sugumar Krishnamoorthy**  
Quality Assurance as “Quality Insurance” — focusing on risk-based coverage that enables confident, compliant product releases.

I am a product-aligned Quality Engineering professional with 14 years of experience working at the intersection of Product, Engineering, and Business teams. My focus is on ensuring that complex digital products are built with clarity, quality, and scalability from the start.

Over the years, my role has evolved beyond traditional QA. I regularly partner with Product Managers and stakeholders to:
- Clarify business problems and user needs
- Translate requirements into clear acceptance criteria
- Identify gaps and risks early in the product lifecycle
- Own end-to-end Business Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Support confident, data-informed release decisions in regulated environments

## How I Think About Quality

I view quality as a product outcome, not just a testing activity. Strong quality starts with:
- Well-defined requirements and acceptance criteria
- Explicit business rules and constraints
- Clear guardrails for compliance and risk
- Alignment across Product, Engineering, and Operations

My approach emphasizes prevention over detection — identifying risks and ambiguities during discovery and refinement rather than late in the release cycle.

## My Quality Assurance Philosophy

I view Quality Assurance as a form of **Quality Insurance**.

Just as insurance builds confidence by managing risk, effective QA builds confidence in product delivery by investing the right amount of time and effort into coverage, validation, and governance. Coverage represents how well critical scenarios, edge cases, and business risks are protected, while time acts as the premium paid to reduce uncertainty.

The goal of QA is not to test everything, but to insure what matters most — customer trust, compliance, financial accuracy, and operational continuity. By applying risk-based testing, clear requirements, and measurable quality signals, QA enables teams to release products with confidence rather than hesitation.

## Why Product Analysis + QA

Product analysis and quality engineering naturally complement each other. My background in QA gives me a strong eye for edge cases, risk, and real-world usage, while my product-focused work allows me to think in terms of customer value, scalability, and business impact.

This combination enables me to:
- Build safer self-service and DIY experiences
- Reduce operational dependency through clear rules and automation
- Improve customer experience without compromising governance

## What This Portfolio Represents

The case studies in this repository demonstrate how I:
- Analyze managed workflows and identify opportunities for self-service
- Design compliant, scalable DIY solutions
- Define functional requirements and acceptance criteria
- Lead UAT and release readiness efforts
- Communicate quality, risk, and trade-offs clearly to stakeholders and leadership

All examples are generalized and do not include proprietary or confidential information.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m interested in roles where I can:
- Work closely with Product teams
- Own requirements, UAT, and release quality
- Contribute to digital transformation initiatives
- Build customer-first, compliant platforms at scale
